We can store decimal numbers in variables too. Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

Note: computers represent numbers with finite precision. That's why floating-point operations cannot precisely represent true arithmetic operations, and this leads to many surprising situations. if you are facing one of these issues, open topic in the freeCodeCamp forum.
